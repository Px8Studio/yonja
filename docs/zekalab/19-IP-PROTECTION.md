## Overview

This document outlines the IP protection strategy for **ALİM** (Ağıllı Lokal İdarəetmə Mütəxəssisi), focusing on the distinction between Authorship and Ownership, and leveraging local regulations for tax benefits and stronger legal defense.

---

## 1. The Legal Setup: "Inventor-Licensor" Model

To protect the invention while ensuring the company (**ZekaLab**) can commercially exploit it, we separate **Authorship** from **Ownership**.

### Key Concept: Authorship vs. Ownership
*   **Authorship (Moral Rights):** Unalienable rights. You are always the Author. This arises the moment the code is written.
*   **Ownership (Economic Rights):** Transferable rights (selling, licensing, profiting) that can be assigned to the company.

### The Strategy: Exclusive License Agreement
Instead of transferring full ownership immediately, set up a **License Agreement**.
*   **Your Role:** Author/Licensor (The "Brain")
*   **Company's Role:** Licensee (The "Seller")
*   **Mechanism:** Draft an **Exclusive License Agreement** between you (individual) and the company.
*   **Safety Loophole:** Include a "Right of Reversion" or a symbolic royalty (e.g., 1% of revenue). If the company liquidates or changes ownership unfavorably, IP rights automatically revert to you.

## 2. Trademark Registration: "ALİM"

Register the brand **ALİM** on behalf of the **Company** to build commercial goodwill and ensure legal defense capability in Azerbaijani courts.

## 3. Software Copyright Registration ("Software Passport")

While copyright is automatic, a **Copyright Certificate** is essential for signing contracts with enterprises (e.g., DigiRella) or Government Agencies.

| Feature | Details |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Filing** | **You (as Author)** register the source code (LangGraph nodes, ALİM engine). |
| **Beneficiary** | In the application, you are the **Author**; the **Company** is the **Right Holder** (Hüquq Sahibi). |
| **Timeline** | 15–30 Days (Fast processing available). |

## 4. Startup Certificate & Tax Exemption

Leverage the **"Startup Certificate"** from **KOBİA** (Small and Medium Business Development Agency) to optimize the licensing deal.

*   **The Benefit:** Exemption from **Corporate Income Tax (20%)** on innovation profits for **3 years**.
*   **Strategic Value:** Makes the licensing arrangement highly attractive to partners/investors as tax savings can be reinvested directly into R&D (and your royalties).

---

## 7. Legal Persona & Data Sovereignty

### "Mütəxəssis" (Specialist)
Registering and positioning ALİM as a **"Specialist"** decision-support tool (rather than an autonomous agent) reduces liability.
*   **Disclaimer:** "ALİM provides recommendations based on data; final decisions are the user's responsibility."

### Data Sovereignty
*   **"Lokal"** Advantage: Use local hosting to comply with National AI Strategy 2025-2028 and appeal to government partners.
