"""ZekaLab MCP Resources - Read-only data access.

Exports 3 resources:
1. get_rules_resource() - All rules as YAML/JSON
2. get_crop_profiles() - Crop characteristics
3. get_subsidy_database() - Government subsidies

Note: Actual implementations are in main.py for simplicity.
This module is a placeholder for future modularization.
"""

# Resources are defined in main.py as FastAPI routes
# They can be imported here once modularized
